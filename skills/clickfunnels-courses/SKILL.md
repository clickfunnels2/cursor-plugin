# ClickFunnels Courses Skill

The HTTP surface for creating CF2 courses and their content tree: a course holds
sections (the modules a learner sees), and each section holds lessons. Lesson
bodies are authored in Markdown. This document covers the content model, the
create/read/update lifecycle, and the gotchas worth knowing before you script it.

## When to use this skill

- Scaffolding a brand-new course (modules + lessons) from an outline or prompt.
- Adding sections (modules) to an existing course.
- Adding or updating lessons inside a section, with Markdown bodies.
- Reading back a course's structure (sections, then lessons per section).
- Publishing a completed course, all eligible modules, and their lessons in one step.

## How a course is structured

```
Course
  Root section          (auto-created, titled "Primary module")
    Section  (module)    <- what you create via the API
      Lesson
      Lesson
    Section  (module)
      Lesson
```

Every course is provisioned with one **root section** the moment it is created;
its id comes back as `root_section_id`. You never create it and it is not shown in
the course builder UI - it is the implicit parent of every top-level module. The
API sections list, however, DOES return it (the entry whose `parent_id` is `null`,
matching the course's `root_section_id`); most integrations can ignore that entry
and treat its children as the modules.

Two facts shape how you script content creation:

- **Sections you create via the API are top-level modules.** The create/update
  payloads do not accept a `parent_id` or a `sort_order`, so a new section is
  attached under the root and appended after the existing modules. Building
  multi-level nesting or re-ordering modules is done in the course builder UI,
  not through this API.
- **Lessons always belong to a section.** You create them under a specific
  `section_id`, never directly under the course.

## Authentication

OAuth2 password grant using an OAuth application's credentials. The same
access token is used across the CF2 public API surfaces.

Course, section, and lesson **writes** (create/update) are available to any OAuth token
authorized for the workspace. **Reads** are likewise available wherever the token has
access to the workspace.

## Endpoint reference

| Action          | Method | Path                                              |
|-----------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------|
| List courses    | GET    | `/api/v2/workspaces/:workspace_id/courses`        |
| Create course   | POST   | `/api/v2/workspaces/:workspace_id/courses`        |
| Show course     | GET    | `/api/v2/courses/:id`                             |
| List sections   | GET    | `/api/v2/courses/:course_id/sections`             |
| Create section  | POST   | `/api/v2/courses/:course_id/sections`             |
| Show section    | GET    | `/api/v2/courses/sections/:id`                    |
| Update section  | PATCH  | `/api/v2/courses/sections/:id`                    |
| Publish section | POST   | `/api/v2/courses/sections/:id/publish`            |
| List lessons    | GET    | `/api/v2/courses/sections/:section_id/lessons`    |
| Create lesson   | POST   | `/api/v2/courses/sections/:section_id/lessons`    |
| Show lesson     | GET    | `/api/v2/courses/lessons/:id`                     |
| Update lesson   | PATCH  | `/api/v2/courses/lessons/:id`                     |
| Publish lesson  | POST   | `/api/v2/courses/lessons/:id/publish`             |
| Publish course or whole tree | POST | `/api/v2/courses/:id/publish`              |
| Publish sections| POST   | `/api/v2/courses/:course_id/sections/publish_actions` |
| List publish actions | GET | `/api/v2/courses/:course_id/sections/publish_actions` |
| Show publish action  | GET | `/api/v2/courses/sections/publish_actions/:id`   |

Note the two path shapes: collections that belong to a parent are nested under
it (`/courses/:course_id/sections`), while showing/updating a single section or
lesson uses the flat `/courses/sections/:id` and `/courses/lessons/:id` forms.

## Creating a course

```http
POST /api/v2/workspaces/365069/courses
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "course": {
    "title": "Agentic Engineering for Senior Software Engineers",
    "description": "A hands-on program on designing, building, and operating agentic AI systems."
  }
}
```

On success: **201 Created** with the course. Capture `id` (use it as
`:course_id`) and `root_section_id`.

```json
{
  "id": 86816,
  "public_id": "vERkqB",
  "title": "Agentic Engineering for Senior Software Engineers",
  "published_at": null,
  "root_section_id": 490402,
  "description": "A hands-on program on designing, building, and operating agentic AI systems.",
  "current_path": "/agentic-engineering-for-senior-software-engineers",
  "show_in_community": false,
  "show_to_non_members": false,
  "upgrade_url": null,
  "redirect_to_full_course": true,
  "unauthorized_redirect_url": null,
  "comments_enabled": false,
  "created_at": "2026-06-30T15:56:18.369Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-06-30T15:56:18.508Z",
  "image_url": null
}
```

### Permitted course fields

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `title` | string | Required. The slug (`current_path`) is derived from it. |
| `description` | string | Short course summary. |
| `show_in_community` | boolean | Surface the course in the community area. |
| `redirect_to_full_course` | boolean | Redirect behavior for members. |
| `image_id` | id | Cover image - id of a workspace Image resource. |

## Sections (modules)

Create a module under a course. Only `title` is required.

```http
POST /api/v2/courses/86816/sections
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "courses_section": {
    "title": "Course Orientation and Mental Models",
    "description": "Module for senior engineers."
  }
}
```

Returns **201 Created**:

```json
{
  "id": 490404,
  "public_id": "erqaPn",
  "course_id": 86816,
  "title": "Course Orientation and Mental Models",
  "published_at": null,
  "description": "Module for senior engineers.",
  "days_till_drip_access": null,
  "blocker_section_id": null,
  "blocker_lesson_id": null,
  "current_path": "/course-orientation-and-mental-models",
  "is_hidden_from_non_members": true,
  "upgrade_url": null,
  "parent_id": 490402,
  "sort_order": 1,
  "created_at": "2026-06-30T15:57:00.738Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-06-30T15:57:00.738Z"
}
```

`parent_id` comes back set to the course's `root_section_id` and `sort_order` is
assigned automatically (it appends after the existing modules). Neither field is
settable from this API.

### Permitted section fields (create and update)

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `title` | string | Required. |
| `description` | string | Short module summary. |
| `days_till_drip_access` | integer | Drip delay in days; must be > 0 when set. |
| `is_hidden_from_non_members` | boolean | Hide the module from non-members. |
| `blocker_section_id` | id | Gate this module behind another section. |
| `blocker_lesson_id` | id | Gate this module behind a specific lesson. |

Update a module, including its `title`, with
`PATCH /api/v2/courses/sections/:id` and the same `courses_section` body.
Returns **200 OK** with the updated section.

## Lessons

Create a lesson inside a section. The body is authored in Markdown via
`lesson_content`, which is rendered into the lesson's page.

```http
POST /api/v2/courses/sections/490404/lessons
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "courses_lesson": {
    "title": "Why agentic systems break in production",
    "lesson_content": "## The core failure modes\n\n- Context drift across turns\n- Tool calls that silently fail\n- Unbounded retries\n\nIn this lesson we map each failure mode to a concrete mitigation."
  }
}
```

Returns **201 Created**:

```json
{
  "id": 1407244,
  "public_id": "xGGOWg",
  "title": "Why agentic systems break in production",
  "body": null,
  "section_id": 490404,
  "published_at": null,
  "current_path": "/why-agentic-systems-break-in-production",
  "sort_order": 0,
  "created_at": "2026-06-30T16:09:52.299Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-06-30T16:09:52.434Z"
}
```

### Permitted lesson fields

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `title` | string | Required. |
| `lesson_content` | Markdown | Rendered into the lesson page on create. Headings, lists, and paragraphs are supported. |
| `body` | string | Plain text/HTML body field, kept separate from the rendered page content. |
| `image_id` | id | Lesson image - id of a workspace Image resource. |

Update a lesson, including its `title` or `body`, with
`PATCH /api/v2/courses/lessons/:id` and a `courses_lesson` body. Returns
**200 OK** with the updated lesson.

List a section's lessons with `GET /api/v2/courses/sections/:section_id/lessons`:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1407244,
    "public_id": "xGGOWg",
    "title": "Why agentic systems break in production",
    "body": null,
    "section_id": 490404,
    "published_at": null,
    "current_path": "/why-agentic-systems-break-in-production",
    "sort_order": 0,
    "created_at": "2026-06-30T16:09:52.299Z",
    "updated_at": "2026-06-30T16:09:52.434Z"
  }
]
```

## Publishing

New courses, sections, and lessons start unpublished (`published_at: null`).
There are five useful publishing flows. On each direct publish endpoint, omit
`published_at` to publish now or pass a future ISO 8601 datetime to schedule it.
A past value returns **422** without changing the requested resource.

**Publish only the course record** - `POST /api/v2/courses/:id/publish` with no
body. This leaves its sections and lessons as drafts. Pass `published_at` to
schedule the course record instead of publishing it immediately. Returns **200
OK** with the course.

```http
POST /api/v2/courses/86816/publish
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{ "published_at": "2026-08-01T09:00:00Z" }
```

**Publish one lesson** - `POST /api/v2/courses/lessons/:id/publish`. This is the
only way to set a lesson's publish timestamp; `published_at` is intentionally not
writable through the lesson update endpoint.

```http
POST /api/v2/courses/lessons/1407244/publish
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{}
```

The response is the updated lesson. To schedule it instead, send a future time:

```json
{ "published_at": "2026-08-01T09:00:00Z" }
```

**Publish one section and its lessons** -
`POST /api/v2/courses/sections/:id/publish`. The section and each draft or
scheduled lesson receive the requested publish timestamp. This direct form does
not grant or notify existing enrollees; use a section publish action when you need
those options. The root section cannot be published directly.

```http
POST /api/v2/courses/sections/490404/publish
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{}
```

The **200 OK** response is the updated section:

```json
{
  "id": 490404,
  "public_id": "erqaPn",
  "title": "Course Orientation and Mental Models",
  "published_at": "2026-07-21T15:10:00.000Z"
}
```

If section or lesson validation fails, the request returns **422** and no publish
timestamps are changed.

**Recommended: publish the whole content tree in one step** - pass
`publish_sections_and_lessons: true`. The API sets the course, eligible section,
and lesson publish timestamps before returning **200 OK**. It also queues
per-section follow-up actions; those actions may still be running after the
response. The response is the course, not a progress receipt.

```http
POST /api/v2/courses/86816/publish
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{ "publish_sections_and_lessons": true }
```

To schedule the whole tree, include both a future `published_at` and
`publish_sections_and_lessons: true`. Eligible sections receive scheduled
actions and lessons receive the future course timestamp. Sections with an
intentional drip or blocker keep that access gate; their lessons are timestamped
so they are ready when the gate grants access.

**Publish selected sections (async)** - create a section publish action. Choose
exactly one selector: `target_ids` (section public ids) or `target_all: true`
(every unpublished non-root section). Passing the root section public id has the
same expansion behavior as `target_all`. Each selected section and its
unpublished or scheduled lessons are published by the background action.

```http
POST /api/v2/courses/86816/sections/publish_actions
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "courses_sections_publish_action": {
    "target_ids": ["erqaPn"],
    "auto_enroll": true,
    "send_email": false
  }
}
```

Optional fields are `auto_enroll` (grant existing enrollees access),
`send_email` (notify them, only meaningful with `auto_enroll`), and
`scheduled_for` (a future date-time). A valid request returns **201 Created**.
The response always emits resolved integer `target_ids` and `target_all: false`,
even if the request used public ids or `target_all: true`.

Fetch the receipt at
`GET /api/v2/courses/sections/publish_actions/:id`. Poll
`status`, `target_count`, `performed_count`, and `published_lessons_count`.
`status` is `queued`, `scheduled`, or `processing`
while work remains and `completed` when it is done. `published_lessons_count`
records lessons this action changed, so it excludes lessons that were already
live. List receipts at
`GET /api/v2/courses/:course_id/sections/publish_actions`.

If a root or `target_all` request finds nothing unpublished, it returns **200
OK** without creating an action:

```json
{
  "message": "no unpublished course content to publish",
  "target_count": 0,
  "performed_count": 0,
  "published_lessons_count": 0,
  "status": "completed"
}
```

## Worked example: scaffold a course with content

```http
# 1. Create the course
POST /api/v2/workspaces/365069/courses
{ "course": { "title": "Agentic Engineering for Senior Software Engineers" } }
# -> 201, course.id = 86816

# 2. Add the first module
POST /api/v2/courses/86816/sections
{ "courses_section": { "title": "Course Orientation and Mental Models" } }
# 3. Add a lesson to that module
POST /api/v2/courses/sections/490404/lessons
{ "courses_lesson": { "title": "Why agentic systems break in production",
                      "lesson_content": "## The core failure modes\n\n- Context drift\n- Silent tool failures" } }
# -> 201, lesson.id = 1407244

# Repeat 2-3 for each module and its lessons.

# 4. Publish the course, eligible modules, and lessons in one step
POST /api/v2/courses/86816/publish
{ "publish_sections_and_lessons": true }
# -> 200; course, eligible section, and lesson timestamps are now set
```

## Reading back a course

- Show the course (`GET /api/v2/courses/:id`) for its metadata and
  `root_section_id`.
- List the course's modules (`GET /api/v2/courses/:course_id/sections`). The list
  includes the root section (the `parent_id: null` entry, matching the course's
  `root_section_id`); most integrations ignore it and treat its children as the
  modules. Ordered by `id`
  ascending by default (add `?sort_order=desc` for descending); pass
  `?sort_property=sort_order` to get the builder's display order instead. Note
  `sort_order` is scoped per parent, so it is not globally unique across the list -
  the root and each parent's first child both start at 0 and are tie-broken by id.
  Every ordering is consistent with the pagination cursor, so the Pagination-Next
  walk returns each section exactly once. It paginates at 20 per page (see below).
- For each section id, list its lessons
  (`GET /api/v2/courses/sections/:section_id/lessons`). Querying lessons by a
  known `section_id` is the most reliable way to read a section's contents.
  Lessons default to `id` order; pass `?sort_property=sort_order` for the builder's
  display order within the section (`sort_order` starts at 0 per section).

### Pagination

List endpoints page at 20 records and follow the standard V2 cursor convention:
read the `Pagination-Next` response header and pass it back as the `after` query
parameter, repeating until the header is absent.

```http
GET /api/v2/courses/86816/sections
GET /api/v2/courses/86816/sections?after=490422
```

## Common errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| 404 "Not found" | The course/section/lesson id is not in the token's accessible workspace | Verify the id and the access token. |
| 400 Bad Request on a section publish action | The `courses_sections_publish_action` wrapper is missing or empty | Send the wrapper with exactly one of `target_ids` or `target_all: true`. |
| 422 Unprocessable Entity | Validation failure on permitted attributes | Read the `error` body - usually a missing `title` or invalid id reference. |
| 422 mentioning `published_at` | A publish endpoint received a malformed or past datetime | Omit it to publish now, or pass a valid future ISO 8601 datetime. |
| 422 on a section publish action | Both `target_all` and `target_ids` were sent, or a target is unknown or belongs to another course | Send exactly one selector and use ids returned for sections of this course. |
| 401 "API key missing or invalid" | Missing, revoked, or wrong token | Re-authenticate. |
