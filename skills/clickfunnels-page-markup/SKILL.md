  Reference for PML (Page Markup Language), the XML-like DSL that ClickFunnels 2.0
  uses to describe page content. Read this skill when authoring or editing markup
  for any surface that accepts a `markup` field - currently pages and blog posts.
  Writing `markup` replaces the entire page and PML covers only a subset of what
  the ClickFunnels editor can build, so read the approval guardrail before
  touching a page that already exists.
  This is a language reference; for the HTTP APIs that consume it, see the

# ClickFunnels Page Markup Language (PML)

PML is an XML-like DSL compiled by the CF2 page engine into the full page tree the
editor renders. It is the canonical authoring format for both funnel/site pages
(via the Pages API) and blog posts (via the Blogs API).

This document is a **language reference** - elements, attributes, design system,
patterns, common errors. It contains no HTTP details. For that, follow the
references above.

## When to read this skill

- Authoring markup for a new page or blog post from scratch
- Editing existing markup returned by `expand[]=markup` on any surface
- Debugging a `400 Markup is not valid PML` response
- Designing a new conversion-oriented page and choosing fonts, colors, gradients
- Composing a multi-section page that follows CF2's design system

## STOP: get approval before overwriting an existing page

PML covers a subset of what the ClickFunnels page editor can build. Four
properties of that subset make writing `markup` to an existing page dangerous:

- **Reading is lossy.** `expand[]=markup` runs the stored page through a
  serializer that has an equivalent for the elements documented in this skill
  and nothing else. Any other element the editor supports is dropped from the
  string you get back: the element, its settings and its styling are simply
  absent. There is no error, no warning, and no placeholder marking the hole.
- **An empty read does not mean an empty page.** Because dropped elements leave
  no trace, a page built entirely from elements PML cannot express reads back as
  an empty string. `""` is therefore not evidence that the page is blank, and it
  is not a reason to skip the approval below.
- **A failed read looks like content.** If the read comes back as
  `<!-- markup unavailable: page tree could not be serialized -->`, the
  serializer could not handle the page at all. Treat the page as unreadable and
  do not write. Sending that string back replaces the page with nothing.
- **Writing replaces everything.** Sending `markup` rebuilds the page from your
  string and overwrites both the published page and the draft the editor opens.
  Nothing is merged, and there is no partial write.

Put together, a read-modify-write cycle on a page a person built in the editor
silently destroys whatever PML could not express, in the live page and in the
editor, and the API cannot put it back.

**The rule:** if the page or post could have been created or edited in the
ClickFunnels editor, STOP and ask the person for explicit approval before you
send `markup`. Tell them plainly that you are replacing the whole page and that
editor-only content will not survive. A general instruction such as "update the
page" or "improve the headline" is NOT that approval.

You do not need to ask when:

- you are creating a brand new page or post and passing `markup` on create
- you created the page through the API in this session and nobody has opened it
  in the editor since

If you cannot tell how a page was authored, assume the editor built it and ask.
When you have an additive route, prefer it: create a new page and position it,
rather than rewriting a page that is already live and converting. If approval is
refused, the edit belongs in the editor, not in this API.

## DSL Quick Rules

```
<section>          <- full-width band
  <row cols="N">   <- horizontal split (1-4 columns for content)
    <column>       <- content container (NO padding attribute)
      <headline fontsize="72px" weight="black" color="#fff" font="Poppins">
        Text with <span color="#60a5fa">accent</span>
      </headline>
      <paragraph size="m" color="#94a3b8" leading="relaxed" font="Inter">
        Body copy here.
      </paragraph>
      <button bg="linear-gradient(135deg, #2563eb 0%, #7c3aed 100%)"
              color="#fff" radius="full" align="center">CTA -></button>
    </column>
  </row>
</section>
```

**Critical nesting:** section -> row -> column -> content. Never skip a level.
**Colors:** #hex only. No rgba(), no named colors.
**fontsize:** Must include unit - "72px" not "72".

## Choosing a Design Style

Six canonical styles (full hex palettes in the DSL reference below):

| Style             | Use when                                  | Fonts                        |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| modern_tech       | Software, apps, developer tools           | Poppins + Inter              |
| luxury_premium    | High-end services, coaching, consulting   | Playfair Display + Lato      |
| bold_striking     | High-urgency, sales, attention-grabbing   | Anton + Roboto               |
| minimalist_clean  | Clean SaaS, B2B, professional services   | Work Sans + Work Sans        |
| playful_creative  | Consumer apps, youth, creative services  | Montserrat + Open Sans       |
| warm_inviting     | Health, wellness, coaching, local biz    | Libre Baskerville + Roboto   |

## Standard Page Structure

For a sales/landing page (most common):

1. **Hero** - big headline, subheadline, single CTA (padding 100-120px)
2. **Stats strip** - 4-col numbers + labels (padding 0 0)
3. **How it works / Features** - 3-col cards
4. **Benefits split** - 2-col with lists
5. **Final CTA** - gradient section, mirror hero CTA

## Example (minimal valid markup)

```xml
<section bg="#0f172a" padding="100 40">
  <row>
    <column>
      <headline fontsize="72px" weight="black" align="center"
                color="#ffffff" font="Poppins">
        Your Headline <span color="#3b82f6">Here</span>
      </headline>
      <paragraph size="l" color="#94a3b8" align="center" leading="relaxed">
        Supporting copy in one or two sentences.
      </paragraph>
      <button bg="linear-gradient(135deg, #2563eb 0%, #7c3aed 100%)"
              color="#fff" fontsize="18px" radius="full" align="center">
        Call to Action ->
      </button>
    </column>
  </row>
</section>
```

## Common Validation Errors

These are the DSL parser errors returned at validate time. HTTP-level errors
(401, 404, etc.) live in the consuming API skill (Pages or Blogs).

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| 400 "Markup is not valid PML: unknown top-level element(s)" | Unknown DSL tag at the top level | Check element name in the DSL reference below |
| 400 "Markup is not valid PML: no PML elements found" | Plain text or raw HTML in the `markup` field | Wrap content in valid PML elements (`<section>`, `<saved-section>`, etc.) |
| 400 "`<column>` element must be inside a `<row>`" | Nesting violation | Always nest section -> row -> column -> content |
| 400 "Invalid attribute(s) '...' on `<element>`" | Attribute is not allowed on that element (e.g., `margintop` on `<input>`) | Check the per-element attribute lists below |
| 400 "Markup appears to be truncated: ..." | The `markup` you sent stops mid-construct - a tag, attribute value, comment or `<customhtml>` body never closes, or elements are still open at the end of the document. Almost always means your markup was cut off before you finished writing it (an output token limit, a truncated buffer). | Re-send the complete document. Do NOT retry with the same truncated string, and do NOT try to "repair" it by sending only the tail - `markup` replaces the whole page, so a partial document deletes everything after the cut-off point. If the page is long, add the pixel or code with `head_code`/`footer_code` instead of rewriting the body. |

================================================================================
## 2. DSL OVERVIEW
================================================================================

  PML is an XML-like format compiled by the CF2 page engine into a full
  page tree. After a successful `POST`/`PATCH` to the consuming API, the
  page is immediately live.

### Mandatory Nesting Rules

  Every <section> must contain >=1 <row>
  Every <row>    must contain >=1 <column>
  All content elements must live inside a <column>

  WRONG (400 error):
    <section><headline>Text</headline></section>
    <section><column>...</column></section>

  CORRECT:
    <section>
      <row>
        <column>
          <headline>Text</headline>
        </column>
      </row>
    </section>

### Page Structure

  A page is a flat sequence of <section> elements.
  Each section is a full-width horizontal band.
  Sections stack vertically top to bottom.


================================================================================
## 3. STRUCTURE ELEMENTS
================================================================================

### <section>

  Full-width container. Top-level page band.

                    e.g. bgprompt="dark geometric grid pattern, subtle blue glow"
    padding         "vertical horizontal" px. Default "80 20". Single value = all sides.
    padding-mobile  Same format, applies at <=700px. Default "56 16"

    Montserrat + Open Sans           -> professional versatile
    NEVER pair fonts with similar character shapes (e.g., Roboto + Open Sans)

### <headline>

  Primary heading. Size xl-s or override with fontsize.

  <headline fontsize="80px" weight="black" align="center" color="#fff" font="Poppins">
    Build Pages <span color="#a78bfa">That Convert</span>
  </headline>

### <subheadline>

  Secondary heading. Sits below headline.

  <subheadline size="l" color="#94a3b8" align="center" weight="medium" font="Inter">
    The API that writes itself
  </subheadline>

### <paragraph>

  Body copy. Use leading="relaxed" for comfortable reading.

  <paragraph size="m" color="#64748b" align="center" leading="relaxed">
    One HTTP call. DSL markup in. Full rendered page out.
  </paragraph>

### Inline Formatting

  Works inside all text elements:
    <b>bold</b>
    <i>italic</i>
    <span color="#f59e0b">colored text</span>
    <span bg="#fef3c7" color="#92400e">highlighted</span>
    Line One<br/>Line Two

### Text encoding (non-ASCII characters)

  Type accented letters and punctuation as their literal UTF-8 characters
  (umlauts, accents, em dash, curly quotes, arrows). Do NOT use HTML character
  entities such as &mdash;, &rarr;, &nbsp;, or &amp; inside text - they are not
  decoded on a page and render literally (e.g. "&mdash;" shows up verbatim) or
  are dropped entirely. Write the em dash character itself, "und" instead of
  "&amp;", and so on. (Raw HTML inside <customhtml> is the one exception - there,
  normal HTML entities work.)


================================================================================
## 5. MEDIA ELEMENTS
================================================================================

### <image>

  Attributes:
    src       Hosted image URL (for existing images)
    prompt    AI-generated image - write a descriptive scene/mood prompt
    alt       Alt text for accessibility
    align     left | center | right
    width     "50%" | "300px" | "100%"  (prefer % for responsiveness)
    height    "auto" | "300px"
    radius    sm | md | lg | xl | full | "20px"

  Prompts - be specific for quality:
    WEAK:   prompt="person smiling"
    STRONG: prompt="professional woman in her early 40s, warm confident smile,
                    soft natural light, modern office background, editorial style"

  Include: lighting, emotion, environment, style direction.

  Examples:
    <image src="https://cdn.example.com/hero.jpg" width="100%" radius="lg"/>
    <image prompt="abstract dark navy geometric wave, subtle blue glow" width="100%"/>
    <image prompt="confident male entrepreneur at laptop, golden hour light, rooftop" width="60%" radius="md"/>

### <video>

  Auto-detects YouTube, Vimeo, Wistia, HTML5 video.

  <video src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXXXXXXXXXX"/>
  <video src="https://vimeo.com/XXXXXXXXX"/>

### <divider>

  Horizontal rule / spacing element.
  Attributes: color, padding (vertical space px), width ("50%"/"100%"), align

  <divider color="#1e293b" padding="40" width="100%"/>


================================================================================
## 6. INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS
================================================================================

### <button>

  Attributes:
    bg            Solid #hex, gradient string, or gradient preset name
                  Presets: sunset | ocean | forest | fire | midnight | royal | peach | sky
    color         Text color (#hex)
    font          Google Font name
    fontsize      "18px" etc.
    fontsize-mobile
    radius        sm | md | lg | xl | full | "8px"
    align         left | center | right
    style-guide   style1 | style2 | style3 (visual preset themes)
    href          URL to link the button to; renders as an anchor. Use for a
                  navigation CTA (e.g. "Book a call", a link to another page, or
                  an in-page anchor like "#pricing"). Do NOT set href on an
                  opt-in / form-submit button - that button submits the form.

  CTA best practices:
    - Use high-contrast: if bg is dark, accent should POP (orange, coral, bright blue)
    - radius="full" performs well on most pages
    - Use action verbs: "Get Started ->" "Start Free Trial" "Download Now"
    - One CTA per section. Two CTAs = no CTA.

  Examples:
    <button bg="linear-gradient(135deg, #7c3aed 0%, #2563eb 100%)"
            color="#fff" font="Poppins" fontsize="18px" radius="full" align="center">
      Get Started Free ->
    </button>
    <button bg="sunset" color="#fff" radius="lg" align="center">Learn More</button>

### <input>

  Attributes:
    label         Field label
    type          name | first_name | last_name | email | phone_number |
                  shipping_address | shipping_city | shipping_state |
                  shipping_country | shipping_zip | text
    placeholder   Hint text
    required      "true" | "false"
    width         "100%" | "300px"
    radius        sm | md | lg | "8px"
    border        thin | medium | thick | "2 solid #ccc"
    padding       px

  ! **`<input>` does NOT accept `margintop` / `margintop-mobile`** - those
     attributes are content-element-only (headline, paragraph, button,
     image, list, accordion, countdown). Sending one on `<input>` returns
     400 "Invalid attribute(s) 'margintop' on <input>". Wrap inputs in a
     `<flex gap="...">` container to space them apart, or stack them in
     separate `<column>`s.

  <input label="Email Address" type="email" placeholder="you@example.com"
         required="true" width="100%" radius="md"/>

### <link>

  <link href="https://example.com">Link text here</link>

  Attributes: bg, textcolor, margintop

  <accordion bg="#0f172a" textcolor="#e2e8f0">
    <item title="Question goes here?">Detailed answer goes here.</item>
    <item title="Another question?">Another answer here.</item>
  </accordion>

### <customhtml>

  Raw HTML/CSS/JS injection. Use ONLY for things DSL cannot do.

  DO NOT use for: text, buttons, images, lists, cards, layout, spacing.
  Only use for: custom widgets, third-party embeds, CSS animations.

  <customhtml>
    <style>
      .badge { background: #7c3aed; color: #fff; padding: 4px 12px;
               border-radius: 99px; font-size: 12px; display: inline-block; }
    </style>
    <span class="badge">SALE</span>
  </customhtml>

### <saved-section>

  Reference a saved/universal section by ID.
  <saved-section ref="SECTION_ID"/>


================================================================================
## 8. COMMERCE ELEMENTS
================================================================================

  Use on checkout, order, and product pages only. For attaching products to a
  `<checkout/>` element, see the Pages Skill - that surface is owned by the
  consuming API, not the DSL.

  <checkout/>                              Full payment/checkout form
                                           Supports steps="1|2|3" (default 1)
                                           Renders the products attached to the
                                           page's show_page_step.
  <order-summary linked-checkout-id="N"/> Cart + totals (link to checkout id)
  <whop-checkout/>                         Whop embedded checkout (see below)

  <product-link/>                          Dynamic: product URL

### <whop-checkout>

  Embeds a Whop checkout for a single Whop plan. Unlike `<checkout/>`, this does
  NOT sell the ClickFunnels products attached to the page - the sale, the payment
  and the fulfillment all belong to Whop.

  Requires the Whop app to be connected for the workspace (Workspace Settings >
  Apps). Writing this element to a workspace without it returns a 400.

  Use on funnel steps only, and at most one per page.

  Both environments are configured up front; the funnel's own live/test mode
  decides which plan is served. Plan and account ids come from Whop, not from
  ClickFunnels - read them with your own Whop credential (see the External
  Purchases Skill).

  You can only set an environment the workspace has actually connected: sending
  `live-plan-id` / `live-account-id` without a live Whop connection returns a
  400, and likewise for `test-*` without a test connection. Connect the mode you
  need under Workspace Settings > Apps first.

  <whop-checkout live-plan-id="plan_XXX" live-account-id="biz_XXX"
                 test-plan-id="plan_YYY" test-account-id="biz_YYY"/>

  Plans        live-plan-id, live-account-id, test-plan-id, test-account-id
  Appearance   theme="light|dark" (default light)
               accent="#HEX", background="#HEX"  (hex only, no CSS variables)
               button-text="Join now"            (empty = Whop's own label)
  Fields       hide-price, hide-tos, hide-submit-button, hide-email,
               collect-shipping                  (all "true"|"false")
               collect-phone="false|optional|true" (default false)
  After sale   after-checkout="funnel_step|plan|override" (default funnel_step)
               return-url="https://..."          (override only)
               skip-redirect="true|false"        (override only)
  Advanced     adaptive-pricing, save-payment-details, skip-utm ("true"|"false")
               affiliate-code="aff_123"
  Messages     unavailable-text, not-configured-text

  Values are checked, not passed through. Every toggle takes exactly "true" or
  "false", the three option attributes take only the values listed above, and
  colors must be hex (`#1d4ed8` or `#18d`) - `rgb(...)`, a CSS variable or a
  color name is rejected. A 400 naming the attribute is deliberate: a typo like
  `after-checkout="funnelstep"` would otherwise be accepted and silently drop the
  buyer's advance to the next funnel step.

  An element with no plan id for the mode being served renders a notice instead
  of a checkout - `unavailable-text` in live mode, where the reader is a buyer,
  and `not-configured-text` in test mode, where the reader is the builder. Always
  set the plan id for the mode you intend to sell in.

## 9. GRADIENT PRESETS
================================================================================

  Use as bg value on <section>, <column>, or <button>:

  Name        Approx direction   Colors
  ---------------------------------------------------------
  sunset      135deg             #ff512f -> #dd2476  (red-pink)
  ocean       135deg             #2193b0 -> #6dd5ed  (blue-cyan)
  forest      135deg             #134e5e -> #71b280  (teal-green)
  fire        135deg             #f7971e -> #ffd200  (orange-yellow)
  midnight    135deg             #232526 -> #414345  (dark grey)

  Custom gradient format:
    "linear-gradient(135deg, #6366f1 0%, #8b5cf6 50%, #ec4899 100%)"
    "linear-gradient(160deg, #030712 0%, #0F0826 50%, #030712 100%)"


================================================================================
## 10. DESIGN SYSTEM - TYPOGRAPHY
================================================================================

  Typography is the primary design lever. Generic fonts kill conversions.
  Commit to a font pairing and use it consistently throughout the page.

### Typography Hierarchy

  HERO HEADLINE    fontsize="80px-120px" weight="black" or "extrabold"
                   Font: Playfair Display / Poppins / Space Grotesk / Bebas Neue
  SECTION TITLE    size="l" or fontsize="40px-56px" weight="bold"
                   Font: same as hero headline
  CARD TITLE       size="s" or fontsize="22px-28px" weight="bold" or "semibold"
  EYEBROW LABEL    size="s" weight="bold" color="<accent>" align="center"
                   (small ALL-CAPS or styled label above the main headline)
  BODY COPY        size="m" or size="s" weight="normal" leading="relaxed"
                   Font: Inter / Source Sans Pro / Lato
  CAPTION          size="s" weight="medium" color="<muted>"

### Hierarchy Rule

  NEVER assign the same visual weight to elements at different hierarchy levels.
  Hero headline -> section title -> card title -> body must each step DOWN noticeably.

### Font Selection by Aesthetic

  Luxury Editorial:    Playfair Display / Cormorant Garamond + Lato
  Modern Tech:         Space Grotesk / Poppins + Inter / IBM Plex Sans
  Bold Striking:       Bebas Neue / Anton + Roboto
  Warm Inviting:       Libre Baskerville / DM Serif Display + Source Sans Pro / Nunito
  Playful Creative:    Montserrat / Pacifico + Open Sans / Nunito
  Minimalist Clean:    Work Sans / Outfit + Work Sans (same family, different weights)


================================================================================
## 11. DESIGN SYSTEM - COLOR
================================================================================

### Color Architecture

  Every page needs three color roles:

  DOMINANT    bg color owning 60-70% of visual weight
  ACCENT      CTA color - must pop against everything (never blend in)
  NEUTRAL     Text, borders, muted elements

### Dark Page Palette Template

  hero_bg:      #0f172a (or #030712, #080C14, #1a1a2e)
  section_bg:   #0f172a or #111827
  surface/card: #1e293b
  border:       #334155
  text_primary: #ffffff or #f8fafc
  text_body:    #94a3b8
  text_muted:   #64748b
  accent:       ONE vivid color (see below)

### Light Page Palette Template

  hero_bg:      #ffffff or #f8fafc
  section_alt:  #f1f5f9
  surface/card: #ffffff
  border:       #e2e8f0
  text_primary: #0f172a or #111827
  text_body:    #374151 or #4b5563
  text_muted:   #9ca3af
  accent:       ONE vivid color

### Accent Color Psychology

  #3b82f6 (blue)       -> trust, professional, tech
  #6366f1 (indigo)     -> creative, premium, modern
  #7c3aed (violet)     -> innovative, bold, energetic
  #10b981 (emerald)    -> growth, health, positive
  #f59e0b (amber)      -> urgency, warmth, attention
  #ef4444 (red)        -> power, urgency, bold
  #f97316 (orange)     -> energy, friendly, enthusiasm
  #d4af37 (gold)       -> luxury, prestige, premium
  #ec4899 (pink)       -> playful, approachable, modern

  CTA RULE: Orange/coral CTAs outperform on most pages. Use high-contrast - the
  CTA must be instantly distinguishable from every other element on the page.

### Gradient Text (dark pages)

  Wrap span around headline text for gradient effect:
  <headline fontsize="80px" weight="black" color="#fff" font="Poppins">
    Build Funnels <span color="#a78bfa">That Convert</span>
  </headline>

  Note: span only supports solid color, not gradient. Use as accent within headline.

================================================================================
## 13. DESIGN SYSTEM - SECTION PATTERNS
================================================================================

  Use these proven patterns to structure conversion pages.

### Hero Section

  The most critical section. If it fails, nothing else matters.

  Rules:
  - Minimum padding: 100px. Cramped heroes fail.
  - Headline: 72px+ minimum. If it doesn't feel massive, it's too small.
  - Single CTA. One action only.
  - Subheadline supports; never competes with headline

  Strategies - pick one:
    TYPOGRAPHY-LED:  Massive headline IS the visual (100px+, black weight)
    IMAGE-LED:       Hero image is the visual; text overlaid or adjacent
    SPLIT:           Two-column - text left, image right (natural eye flow)

  Template (typography-led):
    <section bg="<dark>" padding="120 40">
      <row>
        <column>
          <paragraph size="s" color="<accent>" weight="bold" align="center">
            * EYEBROW LABEL *
          </paragraph>
          <headline fontsize="88px" weight="black" align="center" color="#fff" font="Poppins">
            Main Headline<br/><span color="<accent>">Colored Part</span>
          </headline>
          <paragraph size="l" color="<muted>" align="center" leading="relaxed">
            Supporting copy. One or two sentences. Benefits, not features.
          </paragraph>
          <button bg="<accent-gradient>" color="#fff" radius="full" align="center" fontsize="18px">
            Primary Action ->
          </button>
        </column>
      </row>
    </section>

### Stats Strip

  4-column band of big numbers + labels. Often zero padding (full bleed).

    <section bg="<surface>" padding="0 0">
      <row cols="4">
        <column>
          <headline fontsize="52px" weight="black" align="center" color="<accent1>">10K+</headline>
          <paragraph size="s" weight="semibold" align="center" color="<muted>">Users</paragraph>
        </column>
        ... x 3 more
      </row>
    </section>

  Each stat column should use a DIFFERENT accent color for visual variety.

### Feature Cards (3-column)

    <row cols="3">
      <column bg="<surface>" radius="lg" shadow="md">
        <headline size="xl" align="center"></headline>
        <headline size="s" weight="bold" align="center" color="#fff">Title</headline>
        <paragraph size="s" color="<muted>" align="center" leading="relaxed">
          Brief description. Outcome-focused.
        </paragraph>
      </column>
    </row>

### Two-Column Content + List

    <row cols="2">
      <column>
        <headline size="l" weight="bold" color="#fff">Left<br/><span color="<a>">Side</span></headline>
        <paragraph size="m" color="<muted>" leading="relaxed">Supporting copy.</paragraph>
        <list icon="check" iconcolor="<accent>" size="m" color="<text>">
          <item>Specific benefit</item>
        </list>
      </column>
      <column>
        <headline size="l" weight="bold" color="#fff">Right<br/><span color="<b>">Side</span></headline>
        <list icon="bolt" iconcolor="<accent2>">
          <item>Another benefit</item>
        </list>
      </column>
    </row>

### Social Proof (testimonials)

  3 testimonials is ideal. 5+ feels desperate.
  Real names + headshots convert; generic "A. Customer" does not.

    <row cols="3">
      <column bg="<surface>" radius="lg" shadow="sm">
        <image prompt="headshot of professional in their 30s, warm smile, neutral bg" width="80px" radius="full" align="center"/>
        <paragraph size="s" color="<text>" align="center" leading="relaxed">
          "Specific result quote. Dollar amounts and timeframes beat vague claims."
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph size="s" color="<accent>" weight="bold" align="center">Name, Title</paragraph>
      </column>
    </row>

### Final CTA Section

  Contrasting background demands attention. Restate the core transformation.
  Mirror the hero CTA text for recognition.

    <section bg="linear-gradient(135deg, <primary> 0%, <secondary> 100%)" padding="100 40">
      <row>
        <column>
          <headline size="l" weight="black" align="center" color="#fff">
            Ready to <span color="<accent>">Start?</span>
          </headline>
          <paragraph size="m" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.75)" align="center">
            Brief restatement of the core promise.
          </paragraph>
          <button bg="#fff" color="<primary>" fontsize="18px" radius="full" align="center">
            Same CTA Text As Hero ->
          </button>
        </column>
      </row>
    </section>


================================================================================
## 14. DESIGN SYSTEM - IMAGE STRATEGY
================================================================================

  3-5+ images per page minimum for high-converting pages.
  Hero sections MUST include visual content.

### AI Prompt Quality

  WEAK prompts produce generic stock imagery. Be specific:

  Include: subject + lighting + emotion + environment + style

  Examples:
    WEAK:   "businesswoman smiling"
    STRONG: "professional woman in late 40s, warm confident smile,
             soft natural window light, modern home office with plants,
             editorial photography style, shallow depth of field"

    WEAK:   "abstract background"
    STRONG: "dark navy abstract geometric mesh gradient, subtle electric blue glow
             at edges, minimal, premium tech aesthetic, 16:9"

### Image Style Consistency

  If you're using multiple AI images, write a style guide for ALL of them:
  "All images: editorial photography, warm natural light, professional subjects
  aged 35-55, modern workspace environments"

  Then apply consistently to every <image prompt="..."/>.

### AI Image Limitations

  - Each AI image adds ~3-4 seconds to page load
  - Max 4 AI images per page (12-15s total is acceptable; 5+ = too slow)
  - Use bgprompt on sections sparingly (also AI-generated, same time cost)

================================================================================
## 16. WHAT NOT TO DO
================================================================================

  Architecture:
  x Content directly in <section> or <row> - always wrap in <column>
  x <column> inside <section> without a <row> between them
  x <row> inside another <row>
  x padding attribute on <column> elements

  Colors:
  x rgba() in any color attribute - hex only
  x Named CSS colors ("red", "blue") - hex only
  x More than one accent color family per page (pick one, use it consistently)

  Typography:
  x Same font for headline AND body - always pair different families
  x Same visual weight for different hierarchy levels
  x fontsize without unit - "72" fails, "72px" works

  Layout:
  x <flex> for vertical layouts (flex direction="column" is not supported)
  x cols > 4 for content columns (layout grids can use more; content max is 4)
  x Padding "120" on mobile (set padding-mobile="60 20" for mobile comfort)

  Performance:
  x More than 4 AI-generated images per page (triggers 12-15s+ load time)
  x bgprompt on every section (1-2 max)

  Conversion:
  x Two CTAs in one section - one action, one button
  x Vague copy ("great results") - use specifics ("$47K in 30 days")
  x Hero headline under 72px - if it doesn't feel massive, it's too small
  x Padding under 80px on hero sections - cramped heroes lose trust
  x More than 5 testimonials - 3 is ideal

  customhtml:
  x Using customhtml for anything the DSL can handle (text, buttons, lists, cards)
